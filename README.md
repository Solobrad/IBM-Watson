Technology Stack

Frontend
	Streamlit: A dynamic, interactive dashboard for real-time insights and reporting.
Backend
	PostgreSQL: A robust database for securely storing feedback and analysis results.
	Python: Powering data processing and sentiment analysis with modern libraries.
AI Components
	IBM Watsonx Assistant: Handles chatbot interactions and dialogue management.
	Hugging Face Transformers: Performs sentiment analysis with pre-trained models for natural language processing.
	LangChain: Seamlessly integrates AI components into a unified workflow.
	Prompting & One-Shot Learning: We leverage prompting techniques to efficiently guide the AI model, enabling it to understand and perform specific tasks with minimal examples (one-shot learning). This approach improves model efficiency and allows for a more adaptable system without requiring large datasets for every task.
Hosting and Integration
	Flexible deployment on cloud or on-premise environments for scalability.
